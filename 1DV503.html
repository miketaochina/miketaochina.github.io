    <h2>Pre-Assignment description</h2>
        <h3>READ ME!</h3>
            <p>See if you fulfil the condition listed here and take appropriate action.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you did not install MySQL on your machine, start at STEP 1, else check next:</li>
                    <li>If you have MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin installed, go to STEP 3. If not, follow next instruction: - Start at STEP 2.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h3>STEP 1</h3>

            <p>Install Apache, MySQL and PHP bundle as this will be the quickest and pain-free way to start running your LAB exercises and do the assignments. </p>
            <p style="font-family:verdana;color:orange"># I have installed Apache2, MySQL and PHP@8.0 by homebrew</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Windows & Mac users install <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/">MAMP</a></li><p style="font-family:verdana;color:orange"># I have installed MAMP by homebrew.</p>
                    <li>Linux (a bit harder) users install <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-ubuntu-18-04">LAMP</a></li>
                </ul>
            <p>Run MAMP and start the server. The lights beside Apache Server and MySQL Server should be green. (NOTE: you do not need apache server unless you want to use phpMyAdmin).</p>
            <p>Those of you who installed MAMP will have the phpMyAdmin installed and can be accessed directly in browser by following this procedure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click 'Open WebStart page' on MAMP window; your browser should display MAMP local page.</li>
                    <li>Select 'TOOLS' from the menu and click 'PHPMYADMIN'; here you are!</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Those of you who feel comfortable with phpMyAdmin can continue using it and skip the next step and go to STEP 3.</p>
        <h3>STEP 2</h3>

<p>Skip this step if you have phpMyAdmin and are comfortable using it.</p>
<p>Install MySQL <a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">Workbench!</a></p>
<p>Run the tool and it should connect automatically. If not, check the port numbers and google for trouble shooting. If nothing works we try to solve it together.</p>


        <h3>STEP 3</h3>
            <p>Take a screenshot of your working MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin and upload it to the assignment sheet. If it is not working, upload the screenshot of the problem you are receiving.</p>
